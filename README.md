# â›½ Gas Station

A simple React Native that shows the latest (recommended) Ethereum gas prices, as taken from [Eth Gas Station](https://ethgasstation.info/).

This app is my playground, meant to learn React Native, navigation, and some TypeScript.

## Things I've learned so far:

1. Typescript in a React Native project
1. `React-Navigation` and multiple screens
1. `useContext` and app context reading/setting
    1. Creating a hook to simplfy settings consumption
1. `AsyncStorage` for persisiting data between sessions
1. Using icons and `TouchableOpacity` instead of buttons
1. Using components like `Table` and `SwitchSelector`
1. Using Expo to debug/build a project
1. Suppressing warnings (React NAtive and Expo)
1. Maintaining folder structure
